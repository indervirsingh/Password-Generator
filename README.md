# Password-Generator
How it works:
    1.  The user clicks on the generate password button.
    2.  Then will be asked how long the password should be.
    3.  Then again prompted for each character selected, which TYPE they would prefer (special, capital, lowercase, number).
    4.  Once finished, the generated password will display on screen.
